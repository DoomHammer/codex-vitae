<h1>Codex Vitae</h1>

<p>This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts
that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my
understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is
to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more
effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that
have been helpful to me.</p>

<h2>How to Use This Codex</h2>

<p><strong>If you are DoomHammer:</strong>
- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that  develop
  throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values
  and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and
  values changed?
- Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where
  beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to
  them too rigidly.</p>

<p><strong>If you are not DoomHammer:</strong>
- Read this with the understanding that you are different than DoomHammer— the way
  he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that
  is helpful.</p>

<h1>In General</h1>

<h2>Meta-beliefs</h2>

<p>Beliefs about beliefs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The only way to know if a belief is right for you is to live with it. And
even then your situation will change. Therefore, the beliefs in this document
represent strong opinions loosely held. They will change.</p></li>
<li><p>Articulated beliefs allow for a more efficient life. They reduce the need for
self-negotiating or flip-flopping.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Hence you cannot satisfy all.</p></li>
<li><p>Generalization, however, is needed to form sensible rules.</p></li>

<h1>Fears</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>One major I am aware of is the fear of heights, though I am working on it with my parkour coach.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure. Depends on the case, but sometimes it prevents me from taking an action.</p></li>
<li><p>Ridicule. Most often in situations that do not warrant such fear.</p></li>
<li><p>Making mistakes publicly. I know growth comes from making mistakes, but I prefer to err in solitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Phone calls. I have no idea why, but I prefer to have a personal chat or text somebody than to actually call that person.</p></li>
<li><p>To live a mediocre life. I want to be something when I grow up.</p></li>
<li><p>Being too old to achieve something meaningful. Mostly in the sports department, but translates well to business sometimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Not being able to help those I think I should be able to help.</p></li>
<li><p>Not achieving my full potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Failing to understand my partner.</p></li>

<h2>Quotations</h2>

<p>Quotes and mottos to live by.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt
Excerpt from the speech "Citizenship In A Republic" delivered at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France on 23 April, 1910 </p></li>
<li><p>"(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly (High)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame) I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name"</p>

<p>FAME (title song, sung by Irene Cara)</p></li>
<li><p>"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."</p>

<p>Sun Tzu, The Art of War</p></li>
<li><p>"I won't be a rock star. I will be a legend." - Freddie Mercury</p></li>
<li><p>"I have the right to do anything, but not everything is beneficial. I have the right to do anything but I will not be mastered by anything." - 1 Cor. 6:12</p></li>
<li><p>"Change your mind, you'll find open doors.
If you're able to share, the world can be yours.
They say I'm poor, but I don't feel the same,
The capital I own, is the "P" in my name."</p>

<p>Klangstabil "Pay with Friendship"</p></li>
<li><p>"I exist not to be loved and admired, but to love and act
It is not the duty of those around me to love me
Rather, it is my duty to be concerned about the world, about man"</p>

<p>Janusz Korczak "Warsaw Ghetto Memoirs"</p></li>
<li><p>"Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up</p>

<p>Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature"</p>

<p>Dan Bull "Handsome Anthem Anthem"</p></li>
<li><p>"“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”"</p>

<p>Lewis Carroll "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"</p></li>
<li><p>"I got a letter from somebody here a while back, and they said, "Bob,
everything in your world seems to be happy." That's for sure. That's why I
paint. It's because I can create the kind of world that I want, and I can
make this world as happy as I want it. Shoot, if you want bad stuff, watch
the news."</p>

<p>Bob Ross</p></li>
<li><p>"One is the realization that marketing is a moral obligation. Somewhere in the world is someone who needs help, who wants help, and who doesn't have any help. It's your job to find them."</p>

<h3>What I Failed to Create</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yet again I failed to properly focus on creating an art from a coconut.</li>
<li>I failed to establish a tech-site I bought domains for somewhere last year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Top Habit I've Added to my Daily Routine</h3>

<ul>
<li>Daily Smile (each day, usually after grooming, I take a photo of my smiling face to have a memento that I feel great). Besides it makes for an illustration in my journal if I don't shoot anything better that day.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trips I've Taken</h3>

<ul>
<li>Dolina Charlotty in April. I've learned how to deal with a client remotely.</li>
<li>Grand Tour in May. I've visited 5 cities staying no longer than a week in each of them. The whole trip lasted around a month and I worked and travel at the same time. I've learned a lot about nomad life this way and potential problems one might face. I've also learned that starting is even easier than anyone may think.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Accomplishments and Body Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Increased my consecutive pull-ups from 0 to 10 (and above)</li>
<li>Learned Pistol Squats</li>
<li>Lost fat, gained muscles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<ul>
<li>Met a lot of new and interesting people mainly through the places I started to frequent.</li>
<li>Found out a value of networking. Eg. I met a business contact through a coach I met through a physical therapist I met through another coach.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cat Mode</h3>

<ul>
<li>Created a <a href="https://medium.com/doomhammer-talks/want-to-boost-creativity-try-this-musical-ritual-eebb042151be">Nighttime Birds</a> routine to chill out in the evenings</li>
<li>Started going on weekly(-ish) walks in the park</li>
<li>Recipe for Relax: bathtub full of hot water + aroma oil + <a href="http://www.umbra.com/eur/catalog/product/view/id/2932/s/aquala-bathtub-caddy/">Umbra Aquala</a> + good reading + nice beverage + music (<a href="https://www.ultimateears.com/nl-nl/wireless-speakers/roll-2.html">UE Roll 2</a> can float in the same tub)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Did My Career Grow or Change over the Year?</h3>

<li>Started a company.</li>

<li>Returned to writing for my own pleasure.</li>
<li>Started experiments in personal branding.</li>
<li>Grew enormously in several fields I haven't anticipated I'd be dealing with.</li>
<li>Established myself as an efficiency hacker: I look at the project both on technical and on the process side, talk with people involved, notice patterns and problems then suggest improvements to the said processes, the tools used and also the culture and education. A role crossing the borders of engineering, management and psychology.</li>
<li>Learned the power of marketing. I applied it to an incomplete and buggy product but it gathered loyal customers anyway. This provided a case against perfectionism.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Did I Grow any New Hobbies?</h3>
