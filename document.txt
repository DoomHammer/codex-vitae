# Codex Vitae
This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts
that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my
understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is
to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more
effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that
have been helpful to me.

## How to Use This Codex
**If you are DoomHammer:**
- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that  develop
  throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values
  and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and
  values changed?
- Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where
  beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to
  them too rigidly.

**If you are not DoomHammer:**
- Read this with the understanding that you are different than DoomHammer— the way
  he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that
  is helpful.

# In General
## Meta-beliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

* The only way to know if a belief is right for you is to live with it. And
  even then your situation will change. Therefore, the beliefs in this document
  represent strong opinions loosely held. They will change.

* Articulated beliefs allow for a more efficient life. They reduce the need for
  self-negotiating or flip-flopping.

## Principles
Fundamentals that guide my life.

# Selfcare

## Productivity

### Beliefs

* Reading about productivity can be a good way to grow, but nothing beats *Actually Doing Something*.

* "Done" now is better than "perfect" someday.

* Priority is not plural. Always now your most important task, and treat everything else as a "Plus".

* Calendar blocking makes me more committed.

* When procrastinating clear everything up and start with a Pomodoro.

* Do the hard stuff before 1PM.

* Try to have meetings as late as possible not to interfere with Maker's Time.

* Know what do you want to do. Next Action beats huge monolithic project.

* Keep Inbox Zero, store mail related to projects in some external storage (Evernote, Git, ...).

* Productivity is a means, not a goal itself. Be human first and foremost.

* Context switching is costly.

### Pre-Decisions

* Store ideas in an external storage. Clear your mind as often as possible.

* Note things down when you make observations. Articulation helps with cognition.

* Complete a morning routine before starting work. This eliminates some possible distractions.

* Take Breaks After Pomodoros. Walk. Gaze in the distance letting eyes rest. Breathe some fresh air.

### Aspirations

* Be able to work much less time with much better results.

* Improve focus.

* Improve planning.

* Improve estimation.

* Make Interstital Journaling Consistent.

* Track long-term projects in detail.

## Food
### Beliefs

* First and foremost I eat to give my body the necessary energy.

* But I prefer good food to bad one.

* Mexican and Thai cuisine seem to be my favourites.

* Protein over Carbs.

* Fat is OK.

* Avoid added sugar.

* Avoid added salt.

* The less the food is processed the better for my organism it is.

* 4 meals a day every 4 hours work pretty good.

* Wheat is not very good for me.

* Some dairy products (like ice cream) make me feel funny.

* Too much pu-erh can wreak havoc on both my stomach and my calm.

* Try to prepare meals one day in a week for whole week. Freeze everything you won't eat in the next two days.

* White things are generally bad (flour, rice, sugar, salt).

* Always have a plan for next week's meals. And have some backup quickies for emergency situation.

* Always have mixed nuts and/or protein bars with you.

* Drink as much water as you can. Always have a 0.7l bottle with you: it's not too big to be intimidating and it prompts you to drink it.

* Diets work when they are backed by healthy habits. The less you have to think about it the better.

* Food is a great way to socialise. Both eating out, inviting friends to a prepared dinner or inviting friends to a cooking cooperation.

* Supplements may or may not be needed based on diet and location.

* Money spent on quality food can be saved on medication bills later in life.

* Free isn't a good reason to eat something.

* Do not waste food.

* But when in doubt about its freshness, discard it. Health is the ultimate goal after all.

* Sweets, if not too sweet, are OK once in a while.

* During the work-week prefer easy to prepare meals over fancy ones. Save the fancy ones for the quality time with your friends or with yourself.

* Microwaved fancy meals cease to be fancy, start to taste microwaved. Don't spend too much time on a meal if you want to microwave it anyway.

* If possible order your grocery, saves time and money wasted on eye-candies.

* Restaurants should be for quality time dining, not to satisfy the basic hunger.

* Shopping from local suppliers not only boost the local economy but often can result in higher quality food.

* I love eating and I love cooking. Baking is not my speciality however (mostly because the outcome is not my thing).

* Alcohol should be consumed in moderation and only if it's tasty. Avoid getting drunk.

* When drinking alcohol consume at least as much water as alcoholic beverages. Ideally a glass of water before and after a glass/shot of watever you choose.

* I don't drink coffee due to an unpleasant experience years ago. Cold brew in cocktails I find enjoyable, on the other hand.

* Don't eat to "improve your mood". You'll be sad and fat instead of just being sad.

* I really enjoy spicy food (hence Mexican and Thai) though it can leave my stomach dissatisfied. This is the trap I find myself most often caught in.

### Pre-Decisions

* Breakfast cosists of 4 large fried eggs, optional additives: mixed nuts, spinach, greek yoghurt.

* When in doubt cook chili con carne (or sin carne).

* No caffeine after 2PM.

* Never go shopping for food without a plan.

* Glass of water after getting out of bed.

* Pu-erh, oolong and mate as a wake-up drink. Ideally Bulletproofed (spoon of coconut oil, spoon of grass-fed butter, pinch of turmeric, pinch of ginger).

* When abroad always look for the nearest Lidl, Aldi, Netto or similar. Then prepare some go-to meals to cut on eating in restaurants.

* When abroad try to visit at least one fancy restaurant and one street-food vendor. This is called experiencing different cultures.

* Dark chocolate is a sweet I can enjoy.

# Material World

* Perfect fit is better than perfect pattern.

* The more universal a piece of cloth is the better for me (see: Buff).

* More layers are better than special purpose clothes.

* Quality clothes are usually worth it, expensive clothes not necessarily.

* Best quality/price ration in clothing so far: Uniqlo.

* Have your own style. it is part of your personality.

* Good shoes are usually difficult to get. When you find ones that suit you better buy several pairs.

# Work
## Career
### Beliefs

* Most work benefits from good communication.

* Which means don't hesitate to ask if something is unclear.

* Sitting on a problem non-stop won't solve it. Give your mind a break and it will provide solutions.

* Prefer short focused work instead of multitasking.

* Perfection is rarely reached in a business enviornment but that should not allow for sloppiness.

* Do work that you enjoy, it will be much easier this way.

### Pre-Decisions

* If something is boring automate it or you risk not doing it at all.

* You cannot control everything. Delegate if necessary.

* Know what you want to achieve when starting a task.

### Aspirations

* Teach.

* Start speaking publicly.

* Learn how to recognize poeple worth hiring.

## Business
### Beliefs

* Hiring right people is probably the hardest part of managing a business.

* I am a good at coordination and planning, but not so good as a manager.

* I prefer to be organised and have a plan. I don't necessarily need to stick to it if I find a better solution mid-flight.

* It is better to let people learn from their failures than to always do the hard things for them.

* Team's job is to collaborate and find solutions together, not to blindly follow orders and wait for clues when something goes contrary to the plan.

* Shared values and principles help others reach the same conclusions you would, only without your direct involvement.

* Motivation can be negative and positive. Try to know people's carrots because they can last longer than sticks.

* Marketting is the key. Even if your product is the greatest invention since the wheel, people that haven't heard about it simply won't buy it.

* Passion combined with focus is more often than not a better way to success than competence alone.

### Pre-Decisions

* Think about marketting when you think about the product.

* Hire potential customers of your products, they will have the natural drive to improve them.

### Aspirations

* Start a succesful business that will be sustainable for at least 10 years.

* Build a passive income portfolio.

## Learning
### Beliefs
### Pre-Decisions

* Each day dedicate at least 15 minutes to learn or practice.

### Aspirations


## Passion Projects
### Beliefs

* Ideally passion projects, work and business should overlap, though not necessarily in full.

* Passion is a better drive than money.

* Passion projects are great to learn something new or to grow in something already known.

* More often than not passion projects are about doing, not about finishing the work.

* Think about non-obvious ways how you can apply your passion in business environment. Not every music lover needs to be a musician.

* Creating things brings real joy.

* I always think of myself as an artist, no matter what I do for living.

### Pre-Decisions

* Allocate time each week to do something purely for the joy of doing it.

### Aspirations

* Pursue various side-projects.

* Turn some side-projects into business ideas and try to market them.

## Politics
### Beliefs

* People are by no means equal. We are very different individuals. Any form of generalization is hurtful to some minority.

* Hence you cannot satisfy all.

* Generalization, however, is needed to form sensible rules.

* This means that politic systems are never ideal. We are too complicated for that.

* Assume political people want to do good as far as their context reaches.

* To better understand major political trends consult [this post by JBQ](https://plus.google.com/+JeanBaptisteQueru/posts/RctwmLmRKsW).

* Avoid echo chambers. Try to understand different aspects of an issue.

* Empathy helps with politics.

# Fears

* One major I am aware of is the fear of heights, though I am working on it with my parkour coach.

* Failure. Depends on the case, but sometimes it prevents me from taking an action.

* Ridicule. Most often in situations that do not warrant such fear.

* Making mistakes publicly. I know growth comes from making mistakes, but I prefer to err in solitude.

* Phone calls. I have no idea why, but I prefer to have a personal chat or text somebody than to actually call that person.

* To live a mediocre life. I want to be something when I grow up.

* Being too old to achieve something meaningful. Mostly in the sports department, but translates well to business sometimes.

* Not being able to help those I think I should be able to help.

* Not achieving my full potential.

* Failing to understand my partner.
