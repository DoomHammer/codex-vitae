# Codex Vitae
This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts
that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my
understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is
to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more
effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that
have been helpful to me.

## How to Use This Codex
**If you are DoomHammer:**
- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that  develop
  throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values
  and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and
  values changed?
- Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where
  beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to
  them too rigidly.

**If you are not DoomHammer:**
- Read this with the understanding that you are different than DoomHammer— the way
  he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that
  is helpful.

# In General
## Meta-beliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

* The only way to know if a belief is right for you is to live with it. And
  even then your situation will change. Therefore, the beliefs in this document
  represent strong opinions loosely held. They will change.

* Articulated beliefs allow for a more efficient life. They reduce the need for
  self-negotiating or flip-flopping.

## Principles
Fundamentals that guide my life.

# Selfcare

## Productivity

### Beliefs

* Reading about productivity can be a good way to grow, but nothing beats *Actually Doing Something*.

* "Done" now is better than "perfect" someday.

* Priority is not plural. Always now your most important task, and treat everything else as a "Plus".

* Calendar blocking makes me more committed.

* When procrastinating clear everything up and start with a Pomodoro.

* Do the hard stuff before 1PM.

* Try to have meetings as late as possible not to interfere with Maker's Time.

* Know what do you want to do. Next Action beats huge monolithic project.

* Keep Inbox Zero, store mail related to projects in some external storage (Evernote, Git, ...).

* Productivity is a means, not a goal itself. Be human first and foremost.

* Context switching is costly.

### Pre-Decisions

* Store ideas in an external storage. Clear your mind as often as possible.

* Note things down when you make observations. Articulation helps with cognition.

* Complete a morning routine before starting work. This eliminates some possible distractions.

* Take Breaks After Pomodoros. Walk. Gaze in the distance letting eyes rest. Breathe some fresh air.

### Aspirations

* Be able to work much less time with much better results.

* Improve focus.

* Improve planning.

* Improve estimation.

* Make Interstital Journaling Consistent.

## Food
### Beliefs

* First and foremost I eat to give my body the necessary energy.

* But I prefer good food to bad one.

* Mexican and Thai cuisine seem to be my favourites.

* Protein over Carbs.

* Fat is OK.

* Avoid added sugar.

* Avoid added salt.

* The less the food is processed the better for my organism it is.

* 4 meals a day every 4 hours work pretty good.

* Wheat is not very good for me.

* Some dairy products (like ice cream) make me feel funny.

* Too much pu-erh can wreak havoc on both my stomach and my calm.

* Try to prepare meals one day in a week for whole week. Freeze everything you won't eat in the next two days.

* White things are generally bad (flour, rice, sugar, salt).

* Always have a plan for next week's meals. And have some backup quickies for emergency situation.

* Always have mixed nuts and/or protein bars with you.

* Drink as much water as you can. Always have a 0.7l bottle with you: it's not too big to be intimidating and it prompts you to drink it.

* Diets work when they are backed by healthy habits. The less you have to think about it the better.

* Food is a great way to socialise. Both eating out, inviting friends to a prepared dinner or inviting friends to a cooking cooperation.

* Supplements may or may not be needed based on diet and location.

* Money spent on quality food can be saved on medication bills later in life.

* Free isn't a good reason to eat something.

* Do not waste food.

* But when in doubt about its freshness, discard it. Health is the ultimate goal after all.

* Sweets, if not too sweet, are OK once in a while.

* During the work-week prefer easy to prepare meals over fancy ones. Save the fancy ones for the quality time with your friends or with yourself.

* Microwaved fancy meals cease to be fancy, start to taste microwaved. Don't spend too much time on a meal if you want to microwave it anyway.

* If possible order your grocery, saves time and money wasted on eye-candies.

* Restaurants should be for quality time dining, not to satisfy the basic hunger.

* Shopping from local suppliers not only boost the local economy but often can result in higher quality food.

* I love eating and I love cooking. Baking is not my speciality however (mostly because the outcome is not my thing).

* Alcohol should be consumed in moderation and only if it's tasty. Avoid getting drunk.

* When drinking alcohol consume at least as much water as alcoholic beverages. Ideally a glass of water before and after a glass/shot of watever you choose.

* I don't drink coffee due to an unpleasant experience years ago. Cold brew in cocktails I find enjoyable, on the other hand.

* Don't eat to "improve your mood". You'll be sad and fat instead of just being sad.

* I really enjoy spicy food (hence Mexican and Thai) though it can leave my stomach dissatisfied. This is the trap I find myself most often caught in.

### Pre-Decisions

* Breakfast cosists of 4 large fried eggs, optional additives: mixed nuts, spinach, greek yoghurt.

* When in doubt cook chili con carne (or sin carne).

* No caffeine after 2PM.

* Never go shopping for food without a plan.

* Glass of water after getting out of bed.

* Pu-erh, oolong and mate as a wake-up drink. Ideally Bulletproofed (spoon of coconut oil, spoon of grass-fed butter, pinch of turmeric, pinch of ginger).

* When abroad always look for the nearest Lidl, Aldi, Netto or similar. Then prepare some go-to meals to cut on eating in restaurants.

* When abroad try to visit at least one fancy restaurant and one street-food vendor. This is called experiencing different cultures.

* Dark chocolate is a sweet I can enjoy.

### Aspirations

* Eat more fresh fruit.

* Eat to gain more muscle mass, lose fat.
