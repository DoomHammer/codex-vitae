# Codex Vitae
This Codex Vitae, or "book of life", is a collection of my beliefs and concepts
that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my
understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is
to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more
effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that
have been helpful to me.

## How to Use This Codex
**If you are DoomHammer:**
- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that  develop
  throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values
  and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and
  values changed?
- Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where
  beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to
  them too rigidly.

**If you are not DoomHammer:**
- Read this with the understanding that you are different than DoomHammer— the way
  he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that
  is helpful.

# In General
## Meta-beliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

* The only way to know if a belief is right for you is to live with it. And
  even then your situation will change. Therefore, the beliefs in this document
  represent strong opinions loosely held. They will change.

* Articulated beliefs allow for a more efficient life. They reduce the need for
  self-negotiating or flip-flopping.

## Principles
Fundamentals that guide my life.

# Selfcare

## Productivity

### Beliefs

* Reading about productivity can be a good way to grow, but nothing beats *Actually Doing Something*.

* "Done" now is better than "perfect" someday.

* Priority is not plural. Always now your most important task, and treat everything else as a "Plus".

* Calendar blocking makes me more committed.

* When procrastinating clear everything up and start with a Pomodoro.

* Do the hard stuff before 1PM.

* Try to have meetings as late as possible not to interfere with Maker's Time.

* Know what do you want to do. Next Action beats huge monolithic project.

* Keep Inbox Zero, store mail related to projects in some external storage (Evernote, Git, ...).

* Productivity is a means, not a goal itself. Be human first and foremost.

* Context switching is costly.

### Pre-Decisions

* Store ideas in an external storage. Clear your mind as often as possible.

* Note things down when you make observations. Articulation helps with cognition.

* Complete a morning routine before starting work. This eliminates some possible distractions.

* Take Breaks After Pomodoros. Walk. Gaze in the distance letting eyes rest. Breathe some fresh air.

### Aspirations

* Be able to work much less time with much better results.

* Improve focus.

* Improve planning.

* Improve estimation.

* Make Interstital Journaling Consistent.
